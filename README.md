# PCA_DiabeticReadmission_Reduction

# Introduction
A dataset with over 1 lakh data points was processed to bring out the desired results of reducing the hospital readmisssion due to Diabetes.

# Methodology
At the very initial stage, adequate time was spent to perform data wrangling which includes defining data types, identifying and removing 
the outliers, and transforming the data to the required format.Later, Exploratory Analytics was conducted using Python,  A lot of Calculated fields were created as a process. Also, the Predictive partof the solution involves the successful implementation of the Dimensionality Reduction technique i.e. PCA to identify the principalcomponents from the dataset as the dataset had high Dimensionality. Finally, the Naive Bayes algorithm was selected as it was giving highaccuracy scores to the model and our dataset was even not violating any underlying assumptions for the machine learning algorithm.

# Note:
For answering some complex Business queries  BI tool(Tableau) has been used. As a process alot of new Calculated fields have been created 
to address the problem and solution to that problem in a better way.

# Package Used
Majour Use of Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, matplotlib , Seaborne and pywaffle

# Predictive Modelling
As the data was high Dimensional, implementing Dimensionality reduction becomes necessary. So PCA was applied to bring out the principal 
components and later Naive Bayes was applied to predict the readmissions effectively.

# Accuracy
The Accuracy for the Problem given comes out to be around 87%.
