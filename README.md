# PCA_DiabeticReadmission_Reduction

# Introduction
A dataset with over 1 lakh data points was processed to bring out the desired results of reducing the hospital readmisssion due to Diabetes.

# Methodology
At the very initial stage, adequate time was spent to perform data wrangling which includes defining data types, identifying and removing 
the outliers, and transforming the data to the required format.Later, Exploratory Analytics was conducted using Python, and to answer 
complex queries related to the B.Case BI tools were used. A lot of Calculated fields were created as a process. Also, the Predictive part
of the solution involves the successful implementation of the Dimensionality Reduction technique i.e. PCA to identify the principal
components from the dataset as the dataset had high Dimensionality. Finally, the Naive Bayes algorithm was selected as it was giving high
accuracy scores to the model and our dataset was even not violating any underlying assumptions for the machine learning algorithm.
